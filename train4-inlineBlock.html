<!-- "div" tag is a block element while the "span" tag is an inline element.
 The difference between inline and block elements is that inline elements only take up as much width as necessary, while block elements start on a new line and take up the full width available. In this example, the paragraph and div are block elements, while the link and span are inline elements. -->
